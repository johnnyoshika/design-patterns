Lazy Initialization: simple but repetitive
Virtual Proxy: effective, but can create identity problems
Value Holder: Less abstract and more complex, but no identity problems. .Net's Lazy<T> uses this pattern
Ghost: Less chatty (i.e. less round trips to the database for multiple lazy loaded properties), but more complex and violates SRP (Single Responsibility Pattern)
